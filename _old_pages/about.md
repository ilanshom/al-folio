I am an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
My main research interests are in <em>information theory</em> and its applications, particularly to <em>computational biology</em>.

<!-- My group seeks to develop theoretical models
Information theory and applications
Algorithms for analyzing genomic data
Machine learning and applications -->


<!-- I recently joined the ECE department at UIUC as an assistant professor. Previously I was at the Data Science team at Human Longevity, Inc., where I worked on computational methods for analyzing genomic data and on disease risk prediction models for multi-omic data.

From June 2015 to July 2017, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the NSF Center for Science of Information working with Prof. Tom Courtade at UC Berkeley and Prof. David Tse at Stanford University. -->


<!-- Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Simons Institute at UC Berkeley during Spring 2015. I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University in August 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Salman Avestimehr. I was part of the Foundations of Information Engineering (FoIE) group. I received my B.S. in Mathematics and ECE from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Worcester, MA, in 2009. I spent the summer of 2011 as an intern at HP Labs, in Palo Alto, CA. -->
